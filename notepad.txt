To do:
Convo with Albert login - email Auth - IT security. Look at login credentials for security - e.g ensure only company domain emails can be used for account login

Bank app - logout after 15 minutes - timeout screen with pin

Standardize initial - confirm with Danielle what we expect there - e.g enter your name 

Documentation on who gets to do what - auth roles for companies/departments - regular, elevated, admin (in context of their company/department - not same as an app admin) 

each request gets sent to the head of the company 

Reports:
Admin users can generate reports 
What was deposited this month (Within a specific time range)
equipment info (type, location...etc) 

Edit history (implement a version history to track who made changes, just until all paper info is entered into the database)
Going forward clients are only people that can edit their requests
